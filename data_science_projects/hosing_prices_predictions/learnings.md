## ðŸ“š Learnings From Housing Prices Predictions

### Things i did well:

- I really digested the business problem in this project, and it is evident to the bespoke transformations in the data
- My model evaluatiuon and checking was thorough and my experimentation with XGBoost was something i was not initally familiar with but i beleive i utilised it optimally.
- My code has improved in efficiency and my approach to the problem i think yielded a satisfactory result
- Completing PCA analysis (although not useful in this instance) was a really nice idea when dealing with large amounts of variables
- The set up of the project made it easy to work on it
  - setting up poetry project/environment
  - creating a data transformation function
  - creating a modelling and data exploration file to make it easier to read

### Things i can improve on:
- I could of used pipelines to create the data transformations
- I did not realise at the time that the test data would be vastly different and although its fine to drop columns when modelling, i could not reuse the existing function as it dropped rows.
- I could of utilised Azure Synapse studio and purchased some compute to optimise the model further for a better result
- Automating the extraction of data from kaggle and uploading the results would be a nice automation


Overall it was a good experience, i enjoyed really taking the time to digest the problem and think of creative and intuitive ways to solve it. 

It would be interesting to see my progress in this area over time.
